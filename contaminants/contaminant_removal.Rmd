The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the effects of contaminant removal.
Initially I thought I would not need to do this, as Xinzhao ran some read-level
decontamination that seemed to remove most of the major contaminants. However,
after some strange results further down the pipeline, I've decided to revisit
the issue of decontamination.

# `decontam`-identified contaminants in the species abundance table

I'll begin by loading the species abundances and the list of potential
contaminants identified by `decontam`.

```{r}
stable <- read_tsv("../abundances/species_abundances_not_decontaminated.tsv")

contaminants <- read_csv("contamdf_residence_surface.prev.csv") %>%
  filter(contaminant) %>%
  pull(X1)

contaminants
```

`decontam` identified 34 potential contaminants. Many of these are the usual
suspects, such as `Bradyrhyzobium` sp. BTAi1, but there are a few concerning
species in there as well that are well-known human gut or skin commensals. I
would be hesitant to remove these.

I'll start by examining how abundant they are across all samples. I would
expect these abundances to be lower than in the original dataset given the
read-level decontamination.

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(species %in% contaminants) %>%
  filter(abundance > 0) %>%
  select(species, abundance) %>%
  mutate_at("species", binom) %>%
  mutate(species = fct_reorder(species, abundance)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = abundance)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_markdown(), plot.title = element_markdown()) +
    labs(title = "*decontam*-identified contaminants in all samples",
         x = "Species",
         y = "Relative abundance (%)")
```

A few observations on this:

- Several of the `decontam`-identified contaminants that I was suspicious of as
  they are common human commensals – *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, *Salmonella
  enterica*, *Enterococcus faecium* for instance – have already been completely
  removed from the dataset by the read-level decontamination
- Likewise, *Bradyrhyzobium sp. BTAi1*, the major culprit from the previous
  run, has been completely removed
- The median top contaminant by abundance, *Methylobacterium radiotolerans*, is
  from a genus that is a well-described contaminant of reagent kits[^salter].
- *Halomonas*, which I've incidentally noted to be a likely contaminant based
  on the way it shows up in downstream analyses, is not on the list.

Overall, I'm not particularly reassured by these results. It seems that many
likely true human commensals have been removed already, and if I proceed with
removing the `decontam` list I'll remove a few more. On the other hand, the
*Methylobacterium* species is almost certainly a true contaminant.

Next I want to see how the abundances of these putative contaminants are
distributed across samples of different types, locations, sites and time
points. First, for the manuscript, I'll get overall contaminant abundances:

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(species %in% contaminants) %>%
  summarise(mean(abundance), sd(abundance))
```

## Type

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(species %in% contaminants) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(mean(abundance), sd(abundance))
```

Skin has a substantially lower burden of these contaminants than surface
samples. This is constant with these being true contaminants, as the biomass on
the skin samples is probably substantially higher and would dilute out
contaminants introduced from the materials and reagents.

## Location

I would hope the contaminant burden is roughly similar across locations.

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(species %in% contaminants) %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  summarise(mean(abundance), sd(abundance))
```

It is.

## Site

As with the type analysis, I would generally expect skin sites (and frequently
touched surface sites) to have the lowest contaminant burden.

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(species %in% contaminants) %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarise(mean(abundance), sd(abundance))
```

This is generally borne out. The contaminant burden on park/campus handrail is
especially high.

## Time point

I would hope that the contaminant burden is more or less independent of time
point; any trend or discontinuity would likely indicated a substantial problem
with sample collection and processing. This is easier to evaluate visually.

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(species %in% contaminants) %>%
  filter(abundance > 0) %>%
  mutate_at("timepoint", factor) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = timepoint, y = abundance)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Contaminant abundance by time point",
         x = "Time point",
         y = "Relative abundance (%)")
```

Thankfully, there doesn't appear to be any major timepoint effect.

# Effect of removing contaminants on species abundance

I'll begin by visualising the effect of contaminant removal on the remaining
species relative abundance across all samples. (Of course, if I actually do
this I'll re-standardise the relative abundances).

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(! species %in% contaminants) %>%
  count(sample, site, location, timepoint, wt = abundance, name = "abundance") %>%
  mutate_at(c("site", "location"), str_to_sentence) %>%
  mutate_at(c("site", "location"), str_wrap, 12) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = timepoint, y = abundance)) +
    geom_col() +
    facet_grid(site ~ location) +
    labs(title = "Non-contaminant abundance in all samples",
         x = "Time point",
         y = "Relative abundance (%)")
```

Basically what I expected: most samples are not too much affected, but some
park/campus handrail samples would lose a substantial amount of abundance.

I'll quantify the remaining abundance in the hardest-hit samples.

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(! species %in% contaminants) %>%
  count(sample, site, location, timepoint, wt = abundance, name = "abundance") %>%
  arrange(abundance) %>%
  top_n(-10, abundance)
```

Not too bad at all; only two samples with less than 50% abundance remaining.
Just to be complete, I'll visualise the distribution of non-contaminant
abundances.

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(! species %in% contaminants) %>%
  count(sample, site, location, timepoint, wt = abundance, name = "abundance") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = abundance)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Distribution of non-contaminant abundances",
         x = "Non-contaminant relative abundance (%)",
         y = "Density")
```

I conclude from this that, at least from a numerical point of view, removing
the contaminants would not have a significant effect on most samples.

# Effect of removing contaminants on community profiles

Next I want to check that removing the contaminants would not obscure the true
biological patterns in the data. This is a little more subjective, and requires
making some conservative assumptions about what patterns I expect to see.

Given that we have time series data for each site/location, it seems reasonable
to assume that we should see good clustering by location within each site. As a
contaminant introduced by sample handling, equipment or reagents can affect all
samples (modulo the biomass in the sample), it should be expected that
contaminant removal increases this clustering effect. I'll test for this by
visualising the ordination of Bray-Curtis distances between the samples for a
given site, before and after contaminant removal.

I'll start with left palm as a test case.

```{r results = FALSE}
ordinate_with_without_contaminants <- function(ssite) {

  ordinate <- function(sstable) {
    ordination <- sstable %>%
      select(sample, species, abundance) %>%
      arrange(sample) %>%
      spread(species, abundance, fill = 0) %>%
      column_to_rownames("sample") %>%
      as.matrix %>%
      vegdist() %>%
      metaMDS(try = 100) %>%
      .$points %>% 
      as.data.frame %>% 
      rownames_to_column("sample") %>% 
      as_tibble()
    return(ordination)
  }

  meta <- read_tsv("../metadata/metadata.tsv")

  nMDS_with_contaminants <- stable %>%
    filter(site == ssite) %>%
    ordinate()

  nMDS_without_contaminants <- stable %>%
    filter(site == ssite) %>%
    filter(! species %in% contaminants) %>%
    ordinate()

  ssite_clean <- ssite %>%
    str_replace_all(" ", "_") %>%
    str_replace_all("/", "-")

  p <- bind_rows(list(`with contaminants` = nMDS_with_contaminants, 
                                `without contaminants` = nMDS_without_contaminants), 
                           .id = "state") %>%
    left_join(meta) %>%
    mutate_at("location", str_to_sentence) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = MDS1, y = MDS2, colour = location)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    transition_states(state, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +
    enter_fade() + 
    exit_shrink() +
    ease_aes("sine-in-out") +
    labs(title = "{str_to_sentence(ssite)} {if_else(transitioning, '', closest_state)}",
         colour = "Location")
  anim_save(str_c(ssite_clean, ".gif"), p)
}
ordinate_with_without_contaminants("left palm")
```

Fantastic – removing the contaminants doesn't do any damage to the clustering,
and even seems to bring one stray Residence 4 sample back into the fold. I'll
repeat the same visualisation for the other sites.

```{r results = FALSE}
ordinate_with_without_contaminants("right palm")
ordinate_with_without_contaminants("bed headboard")
ordinate_with_without_contaminants("door knob")
ordinate_with_without_contaminants("park/campus handrail")
ordinate_with_without_contaminants("subway exit handrail")
```

![](door_knob.gif)

![](park-campus_handrail.gif)

![](subway_exit_handrail.gif)

Overall, it looks like contaminant removal wouldn't have a significant effect
on biologically meaningful patterns, at least at the level of clustering by
location. This might be a bad thing: it might suggest contamination isn't
actually the cause of the strange downstream effects after all.

# Decontaminated abundances

For what it's worth though, I'm going to go ahead and generate a decontaminated
species abundances table. I'll then re-run the SourceTracker matching and time
series analyses to see if this makes any difference to the strange results I
was seeing.

```{r}
stable %>%
  filter(! species %in% contaminants) %>%
  group_by(sample) %>%
  mutate(abundance = 100 * abundance / sum(abundance)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  write_tsv("../abundances/species_abundances_decontaminated.tsv")
```
